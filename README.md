Advanced usage [guide](./AdvancedGuide.md)

## Usage

First of all, init SDK with apiKey somewhere at startup of your app

```
Kinescope.shared.setConfig(.init(apiKey: "your api key"))
```

From now you can use most of API through SDK

For example, to get list of videos just call
```
Kinescope.shared.inspector.list(request: .init(page: 1),
                                onSuccess: { result in

                                  let videos = result.0
                                  // save video models somewhere

                                  let metaData = result.1
                                  // check metadata
                                })
```

Than init player instance

```
let player = KinescopePlayer(videoId: "some video id")
```

Add player view somewhere in your layout

```
let playerView = KinescopePlayerView()
view.addSubview(playerView)
```

Connect player and playerView together

```
player.attach(view: playerView)
```

Enjoy.

All controls already included into `KinescopePlayerView` and can be hidden optionally.
